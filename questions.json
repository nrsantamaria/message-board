    "note": "Two weeks ago at EmberConf, we announced Glimmer.js, a component-based library for writing superfast web applications. In the demo video, we use TypeScript to write our Glimmer components. Some people have been asking, what’s the deal? Have we turned our backs on JavaScript and embraced our new TypeScript overlords?"

    "author": "newbieq",
    "note": "I am trying to learn ember but I am pretty new to programming too. I am trying to build a voting app that will let people submit movies to screen in my backyard and let people vote on which movie we should watch. I managed to link firebase db to my site. I can add a post and all the posts will list out on my index page. I have added a vote button and when you click on it a console.log is triggered that says up vote! but I can't figure out how I grab the unique id of the entry then add 1 to the vote property of that entry. wonder if anyone here might give me a hint."
